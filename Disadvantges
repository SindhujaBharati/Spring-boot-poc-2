Spring Boot Framework is not implemented from the scratch by The Spring Team, rather than implemented on top of existing Spring Framework (Spring IO Platform).
It is not used for solving any new problems. It is used to solve same problems like Spring Framework.
It is some what bit time consuming process to convert existing or legacy Spring Framework projects into Spring Boot Applications but we can convert all kinds of projects into Spring Boot Applications.
It is very easy to create brand new/Greenfield Projects using Spring Boot.
